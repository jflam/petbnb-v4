My map isn't rendering because it is picking up the placeholder token from my server/.env file. I want it to use the token stored in the MAPBOX_TOKEN env var instead. please find where this is being done in the code and fix it.

great. for some reason the zoom in / out feature of the mapbox map isn't working. please diagnose and propose a fix.

> Copilot: Let me analyze the MapView component to see why the zoom controls aren't working.

> In the newer versions of react-map-gl, viewport handling has been simplified. Let me fix this by:

> 1. Removed the redundant `viewport` state and `useEffect` - they were causing conflicts with the map's internal state management
> 2. Simplified to use only `initialViewState` for the initial map position and zoom
> 3. Renamed `handleMapMoved` to `handleMove` for clarity
> 4. Removed the spread of `viewport` into the Map component props which was overriding the internal state
> 
> The zoom controls (+ and - buttons provided by `NavigationControl`) should now work properly. The map will:
> - Initialize with the correct position and zoom level based on sitter distances
> - Maintain its viewport state internally
> - Still notify parent components when the map is moved
> - Allow proper zooming via the navigation controls
